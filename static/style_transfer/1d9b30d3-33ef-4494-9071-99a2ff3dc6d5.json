  "thinking_content": "For generating the VST plugin chain for female singer sounds, Step 1. The identified audio effects in order are: compressor, panner, equalizer, and reverb. Step 2. The FX parameter prediction plan is as follows: For the compressor, the threshold_db will be set to attenuate signals above a specific level, the ratio will determine the amount of gain reduction, the attack_ms will be fast enough to catch initial transients, and the release_ms will be set to allow for a natural decay. For the panner, the pan will be set to a slight left position. For the equalizer, the low_gain_db will be set to a slight cut at a low_cutoff_freq with a moderate low_q_factor, the mid_gain_db will be set to a slight cut at a mid_cutoff_freq with a moderate mid_q_factor, and the high_gain_db will be set to a slight boost at a high_cutoff_freq with a moderate high_q_factor. For the reverb, the room_size will be set to a medium value, the damping will be moderate, the mix_ratio will be low for a subtle effect, and the width will be moderate to add some stereo spread.\n</think>",
