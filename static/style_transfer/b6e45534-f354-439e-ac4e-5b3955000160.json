  "thinking_content": "For generating the VST plugin chain for drum set sounds, Step 1. The audio effects identified from the reference are: reverb, compressor, delay, and equalizer, in that specific order. Step 2. The FX parameter prediction plan is as follows: For reverb, the room_size will be set to create a natural, medium-sized space, damping will be adjusted for a realistic decay, mix_ratio will be kept low to subtly enhance the sound, and width will be set to achieve a balanced stereo spread. For compressor, the threshold_db will be set to catch the peaks of the drum hits, ratio will be moderate for gentle dynamic control, attack_ms will be fast enough to control transients but not so fast as to remove punch, and release_ms will be set to allow the compressor to reset naturally between hits. For delay, delay_seconds will be short to create a subtle echo or slap-back effect, feedback will be minimal to avoid overwhelming the sound, and mix_ratio will be low to blend the effect in the background. For equalizer, low_gain_db, low_cutoff_freq, and low_q_factor will be adjusted to enhance the fundamental low-end frequencies and body of the drums, mid_gain_db, mid_cutoff_freq, and mid_q_factor will be used to shape the mid-range for clarity and punch, and high_gain_db, high_cutoff_freq, and high_q_factor will be used to add presence and air to the high frequencies.\n</think>",

It includes a reverb for spatial enhancement, a compressor for dynamic control, a delay for rhythmic texture, and an equalizer for tonal shaping. The reverb has a room size of 0.5, damping of 0.7, a mix ratio of 0.2, and a width of 0.6. The compressor is set with a threshold of -15 dB, a ratio of 4, an attack of 10 ms, and a release of 100 ms. The delay features a delay time of 0.1 seconds, feedback of 0.2, and a mix ratio of 0.3. Finally, the equalizer applies a +2 dB boost at 100 Hz with a Q factor of 1.0, a -1 dB cut at 1000 Hz with a Q factor of 1.0, and a +1 dB boost at 10000 Hz with a Q factor of 1.0.",
