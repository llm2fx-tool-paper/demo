  "thinking_content": "For generating the VST plugin chain for female singer sounds, Step 1. The identified audio effects in order are: compressor, panner, equalizer, and reverb. Step 2. The FX parameter prediction plan is as follows: For the compressor, the threshold_db will be set to attenuate signals above a specific level, the ratio will be chosen to provide a desired amount of gain reduction, the attack_ms will be adjusted to allow initial transients to pass or be controlled, and the release_ms will be set to allow the signal to return to its original level smoothly. For the panner, the pan parameter will be used to position the vocal within the stereo field. For the equalizer, the low_gain_db, low_cutoff_freq, and low_q_factor will be adjusted to control the low-end warmth or muddiness; the mid_gain_db, mid_cutoff_freq, and mid_q_factor will be set to enhance clarity or reduce harshness in the mid-range; and the high_gain_db, high_cutoff_freq, and high_q_factor will be used to add presence or smooth out harshness in the high frequencies. For the reverb, the room_size will be selected to simulate an appropriate acoustic space, the damping will be adjusted to control the high-frequency decay, the mix_ratio will balance the dry and wet signals, and the width will define the stereo spread of the reverb.\n</think>",
