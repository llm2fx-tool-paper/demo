  "gemini_2_5_flash_cot": "**Here's how I'm thinking about this, focusing on creating a kick drum plugin chain for that Singer/Songwriter sound:**\n\nOkay, so the user wants to recreate a kick drum sound, specifically one that's been processed with a stereo widener and a limiter.  The genre's singer/songwriter, so I need to keep it clean, natural, and avoid anything too over-the-top. That means keeping an eye on that distortion parameter; it might be useful for a bit of warmth, but it needs to be subtle.\n\nFirst, I'm thinking about those *explicit* requests: the stereo widener and the limiter. They are a must. The limiter definitely needs to be last in the chain, preventing clipping and managing the overall level. The stereo widener should be near the end, giving the kick drum some width.\n\n<red>Now, beyond the requested plugins, what else would a good drum chain include?  Compression is pretty much essential for drums, to control the dynamics and add that punch. EQ is also a given; I'll need to shape the tone of the kick drum, boost the lows, and maybe tame some muddiness.(out of user request)</red>  A touch of reverb might work, for a sense of space without being too obvious.\n\nSo, here's the chain I'm envisioning:\n\n1.  **Gain:**  Just for level matching.\n2.  **Equalizer:**  To shape the kick drum's tone.  I'll suggest some common kick drum frequencies to target, like boosting the lows for thump, cutting some mids to remove muddiness, and boosting the highs for some attack. I can provide the tool call with default values to get things started.\n3.  **Compressor:**  To tame the dynamics and add punch. Again, I'll recommend some sensible starting points for the threshold, ratio, attack, and release.\n4.  **Distortion:** (Optional, Subtle). If desired, a little distortion for some warmth.\n5.  **Reverb:** (Optional, Subtle). To give a sense of space without being overly obvious, fitting the singer-songwriter style.\n6.  **Stereo Widener:** To create a wider stereo image, as requested.\n7.  **Limiter:**  The final stage to catch any peaks and prevent clipping, also as requested.\n\nFor the parameters, I'll suggest some good starting points, but it's all about fine-tuning to fit the specific kick drum sample and the overall mix.  For the EQ, I'll give some example boost and cut frequencies with reasonable Q factors to start with. The compressor parameters will provide a nice starting point for smoothing the dynamics, while the limiter will be dialed in to prevent clipping, and make everything nice and audible.\n\nRemember, this is just a starting point. The user will need to adjust and fine-tune everything to make it sound perfect in their mix.\n",
