It is the first and only effect in the chain. \n Step2. For the 'limiter' effect, the 'threshold_db' parameter will be set to control the peak level, preventing clipping and managing the overall loudness of the track, aiming for a consistent output level without squashing the dynamics too much. The 'release_ms' parameter will be adjusted to allow the limiter to disengage smoothly after processing, avoiding pumping or breathing artifacts while maintaining the percussive attack of the tabla sounds.\n</think>",

  "gemini_2_5_flash_cot": "**Applying a Limiter to Tabla Sounds**\n\nOkay, so I'm thinking about how to effectively limit this electronic/fusion tabla audio. The `limiter` tool needs a `threshold_db` and a `release_ms` value, <red>but I don't have the audio to analyze directly</red> (Incorrect response despite using audio input, Gemini2.5 flash is multimodal LLM). I have to come up with some educated guesses for these parameters.\n\nFor the `threshold_db`, I know we're aiming to catch those peaks, so a typical range is anywhere from -5 to -1 dB. I'll start with a conservative -3 dB. It's a solid starting point for bringing down the transients.\n\nThen, the `release_ms`. This one is a bit more nuanced and it depends on the tempo and desired effect. With percussive sounds like the tabla, we want a release that's quick enough to avoid that \"pumping\" sound, but not so fast it creates unwanted distortion. I'm thinking a range of 100-300ms is a good starting place, and with the nuances of tabla rhythms, I'll go right in the middle and suggest 200ms.\n\nI'll be sure to present these as initial recommendations, though. I'll make it clear that these values are just typical starting points for an instrument like this and that we might need to fine-tune them based on the specific audio and desired sound.\n",
