  "llm2fx2_cot": "For setting up a delay effect for a jazz electric piano track to achieve a similar vibe to the reference audio, \n\nStep 1. From the reference audio, identify the category and order of audio effects in the chain. The primary effect identified is a time-based delay effect, which is the only effect in the provided chain. \n\nStep 2. Create an FX parameter prediction plan that describes the general direction and approach for each effect's parameters without specifying exact values. For the delay effect: delay_seconds will be adjusted to create a noticeable but not overwhelming echo, aiming for a rhythmic or atmospheric repeat that complements the jazz piano's phrasing. feedback will be set to allow for a few natural-sounding repetitions that decay gracefully, enhancing the spaciousness without creating a cluttered sound. mix_ratio will be balanced to ensure the delay effect is present and adds depth, but the dry signal of the electric piano remains clear and prominent.\n</think>",

  "llm2fx2_response": "<tool_call>\n{'name': 'delay', 'arguments': {'delay_seconds': 0.38, 'feedback': 0.17, 'mix_ratio': 0.4}}\n</tool_call>\nFor a jazz electric piano, a delay effect can add depth and rhythmic interest. I recommend using a delay with the following settings: a delay time of 0.38 seconds, a feedback of 0.17 for subtle repetitions, and a mix ratio of 0.4 to blend the effect with the dry signal. This order of effects is ['delay'].",
  "gemini_2_5_flash_cot": "**My Initial Delay Setup for That Jazz Electric Piano**\n\nOkay, so they're looking for a delay that'll vibe with a jazz electric piano, pulling from a reference audio. This calls for some finesse, nothing too obvious. Right, the `delay` tool. Parameters are `delay_seconds`, `feedback`, and `mix_ratio`.\n\nFor the *delay time* itself, I'm thinking a short to medium delay will sound natural, nothing that\u2019ll sound like a slapback or anything dramatic. I'll start with something around **0.4 seconds**. It's a sweet spot I've found for this type of sound.\n\n*Feedback* is crucial for that \"vibe.\" Too much, and it's a muddy mess. Too little, and you barely hear it. I'm going to set this to around **0.4** \u2013 just enough to give a sense of space without getting in the way.\n\nFinally, the *mix ratio*. This is where the magic really happens. We don't want the delay to be the star, we want it to subtly enhance the original signal. Let\u2019s start with **0.3** - this allows the original piano to come through clearly with the space of the delay.\n\nSo, here's my initial suggestion: `delay_seconds`: 0.4, `feedback`: 0.4, `mix_ratio`: 0.3. I'll explain my reasoning and, of course, remind them that these are starting points and can be tweaked to perfection. We can always adjust on the fly!\n",

Let me know how it sounds, and we can always fine-tune these parameters!"
