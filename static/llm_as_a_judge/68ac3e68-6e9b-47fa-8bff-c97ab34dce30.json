  "llm2fx2_cot": "For determining delay settings for a pop kick drum, \n\nStep 1. From the reference audio, identify the category and order of audio effects in the chain. The audio effects chain includes a delay effect, which is a time-based effect. \n\nStep 2. Create an FX parameter prediction plan that describes the general direction and approach for each effect's parameters without specifying exact values. For the delay effect: delay_seconds should be set to a short to medium time to create a subtle echo or slap-back effect, adding depth without making the kick drum sound muddy or losing its punch. feedback should be set to a low to moderate level to allow for a few repeats that decay naturally, preventing an overly long or self-repeating echo. mix_ratio should be set to a low to moderate ratio to blend the delayed signal subtly with the dry signal, ensuring the original kick drum's impact is preserved while adding the desired spaciousness or rhythmic element.\n</think>",

  "gemini_2_5_flash_cot": "**Understanding the Request & Scope**\n\nOkay, so the user is looking for something related to \"delay settings\" - my initial thought is to zero in on the `delay` tool. Seems straightforward enough. Let's see what we've got in terms of parameters.\n\nRight, the `delay` tool has `delay_seconds`, `feedback`, and `mix_ratio` - that's a good starting point. But hang on a minute... they've given me *audio* and are asking about \"delay settings *used on* the pop kick drum.\" That's not the same thing! My tools are designed for *applying* effects, not *identifying* them. <red>I can't extract settings from an existing recording using what I have access to. It's simply beyond my capabilities. Looks like I'll have to explain this limitation.(Incorrect response despite using audio input, Gemini2.5 flash is multimodal LLM)</red>",
