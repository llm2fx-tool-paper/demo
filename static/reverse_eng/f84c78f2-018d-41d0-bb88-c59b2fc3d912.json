  "thinking_content": "For generating equalizer settings for rock cymbal sounds, Step1. From the reference audio, identify the category and order of audio effects in the chain. The identified effect is an equalizer. Step2. Create an FX parameter prediction plan that describes the general direction and approach for each effect's parameters without specifying exact values. For the equalizer: low_gain_db, low_cutoff_freq, low_q_factor will be adjusted to manage the low-end presence and remove any muddiness. mid_gain_db, mid_cutoff_freq, mid_q_factor will be used to enhance or reduce the body and attack characteristics in the mid-range. high_gain_db, high_cutoff_freq, high_q_factor will be set to control the brightness, air, and potential harshness in the high frequencies.\n</think>",

Here are the equalizer settings to achieve a similar tone to the reference rock cymbal sounds:\n\n1. **Equalizer**: This plugin is used to adjust the frequency balance of the audio. \n    - Low Shelf: -3.0 dB at 80 Hz with a Q factor of 1.5. This gently reduces low-end rumble.\n    - Mid Cut: -3.0 dB at 600 Hz with a Q factor of 2.5. This targets a specific mid-frequency range to reduce muddiness.\n    - High Cut: -5.0 dB at 8000 Hz with a Q factor of 1.5. This reduces high-frequency harshness.",
