  "thinking_content": "For recreating the sound of a jazz double bass with a limiter and a delay, Step 1. The identified audio effects in the chain are a limiter followed by a delay. The limiter is a dynamics processor, and the delay is a time-based effect. Step 2. For the limiter, the threshold_db will be set to gently catch the loudest peaks to control dynamics without crushing the natural attack, and the release_ms will be adjusted to allow the bass's natural decay to sound smooth and uncompressed. For the delay, the delay_seconds will be set to a very short time to add subtle depth or a sense of space without creating distinct echoes, the feedback will be kept low to avoid multiple repetitions, and the mix_ratio will be set low to subtly blend the delayed signal with the dry signal, enhancing ambiance rather than creating an overt effect.\n</think>",
