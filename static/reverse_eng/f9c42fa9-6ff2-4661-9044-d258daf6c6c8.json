  "thinking_content": "For replicating the audio effects chain for a Singer/Songwriter female vocal, Step 1: The reference audio will be analyzed to identify the presence of a Limiter, which falls under dynamics processing, followed by a Stereo Widener, which is a spatial effect. Step 2: For the Limiter, the threshold_db will be set to gently catch peaks and control dynamics without squashing the vocal's natural expressiveness, and the release_ms will be adjusted to allow for a smooth, transparent recovery. For the Stereo Widener, the width will be set to subtly enhance the stereo field of the vocal, adding presence and space without making it sound unnatural or detached from the center.\n</think>",

Following that, use a stereo widener with a width setting of 1.2. This chain will help control dynamics and enhance the stereo image.",
