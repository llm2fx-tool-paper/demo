  "thinking_content": "For processing World/Folk claps to sound similar to the reference audio, Step 1. The identified audio effects in the chain are reverb followed by a limiter. Step 2. For reverb, the plan is to adjust room_size to match the perceived space of the reference, set damping to control the decay character, adjust mix_ratio to blend the wet signal with the dry, and set width to match the stereo spread. For the limiter, the plan is to set threshold_db to control the overall peak level and loudness, and adjust release_ms to ensure a natural and transparent limiting action.\n</think>",
