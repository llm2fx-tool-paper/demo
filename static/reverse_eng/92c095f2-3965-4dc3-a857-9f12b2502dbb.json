  "thinking_content": "For recreating the sound of a Singer/Songwriter kick drum from a reference track with a stereo widener and a limiter, Step 1. The identified audio effects are a stereo_widener (stereo imaging) followed by a limiter (dynamics processing). Step 2. For the stereo_widener, the width parameter will be adjusted to achieve the desired stereo field for the kick drum, aiming to match the perceived width in the reference track. For the limiter, the threshold_db will be set to control the peak level and prevent clipping, while the release_ms will be adjusted to allow the kick drum's natural decay to pass through without sounding overly compressed or squashed, ensuring a natural and controlled output.\n</think>",

Second, a limiter with a threshold of -2.5 dB and a release time of 150 ms to control dynamics and prevent clipping.",
