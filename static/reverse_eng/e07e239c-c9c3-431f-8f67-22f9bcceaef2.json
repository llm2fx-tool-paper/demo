  "thinking_content": "For achieving a similar shaker sound to the reference audio, specifically focusing on the delay effect: Step 1. From the reference audio, identify the category and order of audio effects in the chain. The primary effect identified is a time-based effect, specifically delay. Step 2. Create an FX parameter prediction plan that describes the general direction and approach for each effect's parameters without specifying exact values. For the delay effect: delay_seconds should be set to a short duration to create a quick, rhythmic echo that complements the shaker's percussive nature; feedback should be kept low to ensure the echoes are subtle and decay quickly, avoiding a cluttered sound; mix_ratio should be adjusted to allow the dry shaker signal to remain prominent while the delay adds a tasteful sense of space and depth without overpowering the original sound.\n</think>",
  "answer_content": "<tool_call>\n{'name': 'delay', 'arguments': {'delay_seconds': 0.08, 'feedback': 0.12, 'mix_ratio': 0.3}}\n</tool_call>\nThe delay effect is used to create echoes. For the shaker sound, a delay with a delay time of 0.08 seconds, a feedback of 0.12, and a mix ratio of 0.3 is applied. This provides a subtle, rhythmic echo that complements the percussive nature of the shaker.",
