  "thinking_content": "For achieving a similar reverb effect on pop shaker sounds, Step 1. The primary effect identified from the reference audio and the provided chain is 'reverb'. There is no specific order to determine as it's the only effect. Step 2. For the 'reverb' effect, the FX parameter prediction plan is as follows: 'room_size' will be adjusted to create a sense of space appropriate for a pop shaker, likely a moderate to large size for a natural feel. 'damping' will be set to control the decay of the reverb tail, aiming for clarity and avoiding muddiness, possibly a moderate value. 'mix_ratio' will be adjusted to blend the dry shaker sound with the wet reverb, ensuring the shaker remains present and the reverb adds ambience without overpowering. 'width' will be set to enhance the stereo image of the reverb, providing a sense of spaciousness without making the shaker sound too diffuse or unfocused.\n</think>",
  "answer_content": "<tool_call>\n{'name': 'reverb', 'arguments': {'room_size': 0.85, 'damping': 0.65, 'mix_ratio': 0.45, 'width': 0.7}}\n</tool_call>\nFor the reverb effect on your pop shaker sounds, consider using a reverb plugin. A good starting point for the parameters is: Room Size at 0.85, Damping at 0.65, Mix Ratio at 0.45, and Width at 0.7. This setup aims to provide a spacious and clear reverberation suitable for pop shakers.",
