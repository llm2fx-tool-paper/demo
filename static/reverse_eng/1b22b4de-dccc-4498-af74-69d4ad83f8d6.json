  "thinking_content": "For replicating the electronic organ sound, Step 1. The audio effects chain consists of a Limiter, followed by a Reverb. Step 2. For the Limiter, the threshold_db will be set to control the maximum peak level, and the release_ms will be adjusted to allow for a smooth return from limiting. For the Reverb, the room_size will be set to define the perceived space, damping will be adjusted to control the high-frequency decay, mix_ratio will be set to balance the dry and wet signals, and width will be used to control the stereo spread of the effect.\n</think>",
