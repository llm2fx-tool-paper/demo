  "thinking_content": "For generating reverb and compressor parameters for a tambourine in a pop track based on a reference audio, Step 1. The audio effects chain consists of a reverb effect followed by a compressor effect. Step 2. For the reverb effect, room_size will be adjusted to create an appropriate sense of space, damping will be set to control the high-frequency decay, mix_ratio will be balanced to integrate the effect subtly, and width will be configured for a suitable stereo spread. For the compressor effect, threshold_db will be set to target the tambourine's dynamic peaks, ratio will be applied to control the amount of gain reduction, attack_ms will be set to allow initial transients through, and release_ms will be configured to ensure a natural decay without pumping.\n</think>",

To achieve a similar tambourine sound, I recommend the following plugin chain: First, a reverb with a room size of 0.45, damping of 0.75, a mix ratio of 0.25, and a width of 0.3. This will add a sense of space and depth. Second, a compressor with a threshold of -21.0 dB, a ratio of 5.0, an attack time of 15.0 ms, and a release time of 350.0 ms. This will help control the dynamics and add punch.",
