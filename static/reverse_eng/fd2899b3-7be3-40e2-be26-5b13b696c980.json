  "thinking_content": "For recreating the electric bass sound from the reference track using gain and delay effects, Step 1. The audio effects chain consists of 'gain' followed by 'delay'. Step 2. For the 'gain' effect, the 'gain_db' parameter will be adjusted to match the overall level and presence of the electric bass in the reference track. For the 'delay' effect, the 'delay_seconds' parameter will be set to a short duration to create a subtle echo, 'feedback' will be kept low to avoid excessive repeats, and 'mix_ratio' will be set to a low value to blend the effect subtly with the dry signal, aiming for a sense of depth without overpowering the bass.\n</think>",
