  "thinking_content": "For mixing a rap snare drum to sound similar to the reference audio, Step 1. The identified audio effect is 'distortion'. Step 2. For the 'distortion' effect, the 'drive_db' parameter will be adjusted to introduce harmonic content and saturation, aiming for a prominent but controlled distortion characteristic found in the reference audio.\n</think>",
  "answer_content": "<tool_call>\n{'name': 'distortion', 'arguments': {'drive_db': 13.0}}\n</tool_call>\nTo achieve a similar distortion effect on your rap snare drum, you can use a distortion plugin. Apply it with a drive of 13.0 dB. This will add harmonic richness and a subtle grit to the snare sound, similar to the reference audio.",
