  "thinking_content": "For replicating a classical violin sound with a gain and reverb effect chain, Step 1. The identified audio effects in the chain are 'gain' (volume control) followed by 'reverb' (spatial effect). Step 2. The FX parameter prediction plan involves: for 'gain', adjusting the 'gain_db' to achieve an optimal input level and balance the instrument within the mix; for 'reverb', setting 'room_size' to simulate an appropriate classical performance space, adjusting 'damping' to control the decay time for a natural sound, balancing the 'mix_ratio' between the dry and wet signals for depth, and defining 'width' for the stereo spread of the reverberation.\n</think>",

Following that, use a reverb effect with a room size of 0.45, damping of 0.65, a mix ratio of 0.25, and a width of 0.3 to add a sense of space without overpowering the natural tone.",
