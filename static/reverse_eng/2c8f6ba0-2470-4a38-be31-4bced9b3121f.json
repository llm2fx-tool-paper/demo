  "thinking_content": "For analyzing the effects and settings on the shaker in the reference audio, Step 1. From the reference audio, identify the category and order of audio effects in the chain: The effects chain starts with distortion, followed by reverb, then delay, and finally gain. Step 2. Create an FX parameter prediction plan that describes the general direction and approach for each effect's parameters without specifying exact values: For distortion, the drive_db will be set to add subtle to moderate saturation to enhance the shaker's presence. For reverb, room_size will be adjusted to create a small to medium space, damping will be set to control the decay and brightness, mix_ratio will be kept low for subtle ambiance, and width will be moderate to maintain stereo image. For delay, delay_seconds will be set to a short to medium time for rhythmic or atmospheric echoes, feedback will be kept low to moderate to prevent excessive repeats, and mix_ratio will be low to moderate to blend the effect subtly. For gain, gain_db will be adjusted to balance the shaker's overall volume within the mix.\n</think>",

The distortion adds subtle grit with a drive of 3.0 dB. A reverb with a room size of 0.3, damping of 0.4, and width of 0.5 is applied with a mix ratio of 0.2 for spatial depth. Following this, a delay with a 0.15-second delay time, 0.1 feedback, and 0.2 mix ratio creates rhythmic echoes. Finally, a gain adjustment of 2.0 dB is applied.",
