  "thinking_content": "For recreating pop claps from a reference track, Step 1. The primary audio effect in the chain is a Limiter. Step 2. For the Limiter effect, the threshold_db will be set to catch the transient peaks of the claps, ensuring they do not exceed a desired maximum level and contribute to loudness without clipping. The release_ms will be adjusted to allow the clap's tail to decay naturally while preventing pumping artifacts, aiming for a quick yet smooth release suitable for percussive elements.\n</think>",
  "answer_content": "<tool_call>\n{'name': 'limiter', 'arguments': {'threshold_db': -3.9, 'release_ms': 25.0}}\n</tool_call>\nTo achieve a similar sound, use a limiter with a threshold set to -3.9 dB and a release time of 25 ms. This limiter helps control the peak levels of the claps.",
